Notes about the design of language-python-test
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Why is this a separate package, and not included in the language-python
   source tree?

Mainly because of a limitation in the current Haskell cabal tool. It appears
to be difficult to have a single cabal package which defines a library and an
executable which depends on the library. While it seems to be possible, it is
inconvenient because you seem to have to specify all depenencies twice.

2. For roundtrip testing we will have three kinds of tests:
    - those specific to version 2 of python
    - those specific to version 3 of python
    - those which are independent of the python version (should be tested by both)
